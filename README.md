# VBA-challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to create a script that loops through one year of stock data to output the following information:
```Ticker
Yearly Change 
Percent Change 
Total Stock Volume
```
Conditional formatting is applied to the yearly change and percent change columns. The code at the beginning of the script allows for the macro to run on all sheets. 
```*#Bonus:*
Greatest % Increase
Greatest % Decrease
Greatest Total Volume.
```
